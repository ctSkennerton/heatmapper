NAME
    heatmapper - Make a heatmap from an OTU table

VERSION
    This document refers to heatmapper version 0.7

SYNOPSIS
      heatmapper -i otu_table.txt

DESCRIPTION
    This will run R heatmap and colorize species belonging to the same
    taxon.

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
    -i <input_file>
        A tab-separated community table. Rows represent different species
        while columns are the different sites (or samples). Row and column
        names (headers) are expected. Taxonomic assignments should be
        semi-colon delimited, such as in the Greengenes or Silva formats,
        e.g.:

           k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII;g__
           Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Thermoplasmata;E2;MarinegroupII;Other

        WARNING: THE FILE HAS TO BE SORTED TAXONOMICALLY!

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
    -m <matrix_file>
        Instead of performing the hierarchical clustering of the communities
        based on their euclidean distance, you can provide a tab-delimited
        matrix containing the distance of your choice (e.g. Unifrac
        distance).

    -t <taxonomy_level>
        Specify at which taxonomy level to colorize: 'k'ingdom, 'p'hylum,
        'c'lass, 'o'rder, 'f'amily, 'g'enus or 's'pecies. Default: k

    -l <legend_taxonomy>
        Specify how to display the taxonomy on the heatmap:

        full: the entire taxonomy string (e.g.
        k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII
        ),

        local: the taxonomic group specified with the -t option (e.g.
        p__Euryarchaeota) only,

        auto: everything that comes after 'local' (e.g.
        p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII),

        first: the first element of the taxonomy (e.g. k__Archaea),

        last: the last element of the taxonomy (e.g. f__MarinegroupII).

        Default: auto

    -p <palette_col>
        Palette of colors to use: 'PuRd', an 8-color palette going from
        white to red, 'Jet', a 32-color palette going from blue to green to
        red, 'Jet2', another jet palette that starts with darker blue, has
        less cyan in the middle, and ends with lighter red. Default: Jet

    -n <na_col>
        For species with an abundance of zero, instead of using the color
        specified by <palette_col>, use the plot background color. Default:
        0

    -h <hierarch_clust>
        Whether or not to cluster the samples hierarchically and display a
        dendrogram (0: no, 1: yes). Note: Do not use if you have grouped
        low-abundance OTUs or species into an "Other" category. Default: 0

    -o <output_name>
        File path where to create the output graph. Note that the file
        extension specifies which graphic format to use: SVG, PDF, PNG, etc.
        Default: heatmapper.svg

    -s <width>x<height>
        Size (width and height) of the output image, in pixels. Default:
        20x20

EXAMPLES
    *   SVG output with phylum colors

        heatmapper -i otu_table.txt -s 30x5

    *   PNG output, coloring at the order taxonomic level

        heatmapper -i otu_table.txt -p o -s 5000x1000 -o heatmap.png

    This script is simply a convenient wrapper to draw heatmaps. But all the
    useful code was taken from existing scripts written by Dana Willner.

INSTALLATION
  Dependencies
    You need to install these dependencies first:

    *   Perl

        <http://www.perl.com/download.csp>

    *   make

        Many systems have make installed by default. If your system does
        not, you should install the implementation of make of your choice,
        e.g. GNU make: <http://www.gnu.org/s/make/>

    *   R

        <http://www.r-project.org>

        You also need these two R libraries: gplots, RColorBrewer

    The following CPAN Perl modules are dependencies that will be installed
    automatically for you:

    *   Getopt::Euclid (>= 0.3.4)

    *   Statistics::R

  Procedure
    To install HeatMapper globally on your system, run the following
    commands in a terminal or command prompt:

    On Linux, Unix, MacOS:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make

    And finally, with administrator privileges:

       make install

    On Windows, run the same commands but with nmake instead of make.

  No administrator privileges?
    If you do not have administrator privileges, HeatMapper needs to be
    installed in your home directory.

    First, follow the instructions to install local::lib at
    <http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.008004/lib/local/lib.pm#The
    _bootstrapping_technique>. After local::lib is installed, every Perl
    module that you install manually or through the CPAN command-line
    application will be installed in your home directory.

    Then, install HeatMapper by following the instructions detailed in the
    "Procedure" section.

BUGS
    There are undoubtedly serious bugs lurking somewhere in this code. Bug
    reports and other feedback are most welcome.
