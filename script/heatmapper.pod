=head1 NAME

heatmapper - Make a heatmap from an OTU table

=head1 VERSION

This document refers to heatmapper version 0.5 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  heatmapper -i otu_table.txt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This will run R heatmap and colorize species belonging to the same taxon.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=over

=item -i <input_file>

A tab-separated community table. Rows represent different species while columns
are the different sites (or samples). Row and column names (headers) are expected.
Taxonomic assignments should be semi-colon delimited, such as in the Greengenes
or Silva formats, e.g.:

   k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII;g__
   Archaea;Euryarchaeota;Thermoplasmata;E2;MarinegroupII;Other

WARNING: THE FILE HAS TO BE SORTED TAXONOMICALLY!

=back



=head1 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=over

=item -m <matrix_file>

Instead of performing the hierarchical clustering of the communities based on
their euclidean distance, you can provide a tab-delimited matrix containing the
distance of your choice (e.g. Unifrac distance).

=item -t <taxonomy_level>

Specify at which taxonomy level to colorize: 'k'ingdom, 'p'hylum, 'c'lass,
'o'rder, 'f'amily, 'g'enus or 's'pecies. Default: k

=item -l <legend_taxonomy>

Specify how to display the taxonomy on the heatmap:

full: the entire taxonomy string (e.g. k__Archaea;p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII),

local: the taxonomic group specified with the -t option (e.g. p__Euryarchaeota) only,

auto: everything that comes after 'local' (e.g. p__Euryarchaeota;c__Thermoplasmata;o__E2;f__MarinegroupII),

first: the first element of the taxonomy (e.g. k__Archaea),

last: the last element of the taxonomy (e.g. f__MarinegroupII).

Default: auto

=item -h <hierarch_clust>

Whether or not to cluster the samples hierarchically and display a dendrogram
(0: no, 1: yes). Default: 1

=item -o <output_name>

File path where to create the output graph. Note that the file extension
specifies which graphic format to use: SVG, PDF, PNG, etc. Default: heatmapper.svg

=item -s <width>x<height>

Size (width and height) of the output image, in pixels. Default: 20x20

=back



=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item * SVG output with phylum colors

heatmapper -i otu_table.txt -s 30x5

=item * PNG output, coloring at the order taxonomic level

heatmapper -i otu_table.txt -p o -s 5000x1000 -o heatmap.png

Florent Angly <florent.angly@gmail.com>

This script is simply a convenient wrapper to draw heatmaps. But all the useful
code was taken from existing scripts written by Dana Willner.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Dependencies

You need to install these dependencies first:

=over

=item *

Perl

L<http://www.perl.com/download.csp>


=item *

make

Many systems have make installed by default. If your system does not, you should
install the implementation of make of your choice, e.g. GNU make: L<http://www.gnu.org/s/make/>

=item *

R

L<http://www.r-project.org>


You also need these two R libraries: gplots, RColorBrewer

=back

The following CPAN Perl modules are dependencies that will be installed automatically
for you:

=over

=item *

Getopt::Euclid (>= 0.3.4)

=item *

Statistics::R

=back

=head2 Procedure

To install HeatMapper globally on your system, run the following
commands in a terminal or command prompt:

On Linux, Unix, MacOS:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

And finally, with administrator privileges:

   make install

On Windows, run the same commands but with nmake instead of make.

=head2 No administrator privileges?

If you do not have administrator privileges, HeatMapper needs to be
installed in your home directory.

First, follow the instructions to install local::lib
at L<http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.008004/lib/local/lib.pm#The_bootstrapping_technique>.
After local::lib is installed, every Perl module that you install manually or
through the CPAN command-line application will be installed in your home directory.

Then, install HeatMapper by following the instructions detailed in
the "Procedure" section.

=head1 BUGS

There are undoubtedly serious bugs lurking somewhere in this code.
Bug reports and other feedback are most welcome.
